`LavaCenter Dashboard` is a light explorer for LAVA Blockchains. https://lava-explorer.mellifera.network.

This is a fork of the original [ping.pub](https://github.com/ping-pub/ping.pub) explorer with LAVA features support.

You can do LAVA operations like restaking, redelegating, and more using this dashboard with wallets support:
 - **Keplr**
 - **Leap** 
 - **Ledger**

> ⚠️ **Important Notice:**
>
>  Always double check links and what trx you are signing



### What was done: 
- Added Providers view for LAVA  
- Added dualstaking features 
- Moved the latest [ping.pub widgets](https://github.com/ping-pub/widget) (wallet operations) to one repo to increase code transparency

### How to use it:
